The workflow we present takes as input a binary segmented image and produces a facetized boundary representation.  The segmented image is presumed to contain miscolored voxels, such that the desired b-rep will generally be topologically distinct from the input image's complex of binary-interface surfels.  The first step in our algorithm is a novel boundary point/normal estimation procedure that operates on partially-overlapping subsets of voxels, or {\em windows}.  This step provides a means for smoothing both geometric and topological irregularities, and is a distinguishing feature of our algorithm.  It is the main mechanism for robustly recovering smooth b-reps from noisy voxel colorings.  The window size is selectable; it sets the length scale associated with the smoothing.  The oriented point cloud that emerges from this first step is then used in a Voronoi-based surface-reconstruction procedure.  It bears emphasis that, prior to this surface-reconstruction step, there is no surface as such, and therefore nothing to sample.  In effect, we refrain from assuming that the surfel complex at the interface between mono-colored voxel regions is homeomorphic to the desired b-rep.  The term ``surface synthesis'' might therefore be more appropriate than the standard ``surface reconstruction,'' which we nevertheless retain. The resulting surface is guaranteed to be closed and manifold.  However, depending on the details of the Voronoi surface-reconstruction procedure and the desired mesh density, a subsequent smoothing and decimation step is often warranted.  For this, we use existing freely-available algorithms.

The performance of the proposed method is assessed by comparing its results to those of three comparison workflows.  These are illustrated in flowchart form in \figref{flowchart}.  We refer to each of the three with the name of a key element of the respective workflow.  They are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  {\em Marching cubes:}  The marching-cubes algorithm is applied to the image mask, followed by decimation and smoothing that is identical to what is used in our workflow.
\item  {\em Simpleware:}  The commercial software package {\em Simpleware} is used to generate a triangulated b-rep from an input binary image mask.  The software implements the enhanced volumetric marching cubes algorithm \cite{young_2008}, followed by proprietary decimation and smoothing operations.  Optimal results were obtained by selecting the ``binarise before smoothing'' option, and using 100 iterations of ``smart mask smoothing.''  Otherwise, options are set to standard or default values.
\item  {\em Screened Poisson:}  The oriented point cloud generated by our method is used, followed by application of the screened Poisson surface-reconstruction technique \cite{kazhdan_2013} implemented in the \textit{Meshlab} software package.  The software's default parameters were used.  Only decimation is performed on the reconstructed surface, as the screened Poisson algorithm already performs smoothing on the indicator function.  
\end{enumerate}
Performance is measured quantitatively for canonical image masks defined by spheres of various radii and locations, and qualitatively using a variety of real MRI and CT scans.
