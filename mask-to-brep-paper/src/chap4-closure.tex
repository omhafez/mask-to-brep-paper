The proposed method offers a novel approach to robustly generate watertight surface meshes from binary image masks for the purpose of physics-based simulation, 3D printing, or visualization. For the purposes of physics-based simulation, the surface mesh may be used as input to any number of tetrahedral mesh generators to produce a volume mesh. The method densely samples the image and locally approximates the interface between neighboring materials based on a template surface. The optimal orientation of the template surface is obtained via minimization of a weighted error function based on the difference in the zeroth, first, and second moments of volume between the voxelated sampling window and the region created by the approximating template. Oriented points are placed based on each local surface optimization. By combining the results from each sampling window, the problem becomes one of surface reconstruction of a dense oriented point cloud. In essence, the sampling process transforms the input from a fairly coarse data description in the form of an image mask limited by the voxel resolution, to a much richer dataset in the form an oriented point cloud that provides significantly more data describing the boundary of interest. \\ \\

The proposed method utilizes Voronoi partitioning as a means to perform surface reconstruction from the point cloud. Namely, Voronoi sites are placed on either side of each point along its orientation, and material identifiers are assigned based on which side of the boundary they lie. A Voronoi partition is performed and the boundary is extracted based on facets who share Voronoi sites of differing material ID. This technique takes advantage of the robust qualities of a Voronoi partition. Decimation and smoothing are performed as is commonplace due to the noisy nature of the input data. Comparisons to commercial software show that the proposed approach performs competitively in honoring shape and volume for a suite of canonical examples. The approach performs robustly for a variety of examples from real MRI and CT scans, and results qualitatively compare well to those of the commercial alternative. \\ \\

With the current framework established, the method can now be extended to cases with sharp corners or edges, high-curvature regions, and multi-material interfaces by introducing new interface templates to the optimization problem. Specifically, an edge template would allow for the introduction of three Voronoi sites, and a corner template would allow for the introduction of four Voronoi sites. Doing so holds the promise of generating b-reps that well approximate the surface of objects even if they have sharp edges and corners. This would particularly hold value for cases where non-destructive analysis of as-built engineering parts or legacy parts is desired. Similarly, a template with high curvature that introduces multiple Voronoi site pairs at one time could dramatically improve the method's performance in regions of high curvature. Lastly, multi-material interface templates could naturally be added as well, where the Voronoi site is easily assigned to whichever material it belongs. Voronoi partitioning would be no more difficult in that scenario, either. The introduction of new templates would provide richer data from each sampling window, ultimately concluding in higher quality surface meshes.
